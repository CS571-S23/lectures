# UX Development

<br>

 ...but what is UX Development?

---


The realm of the UX developer exists <b>somewhere between that of the traditional developer and the designer</b>. We’re not really designers, yet to be a good UX developer you certainly need to have an eye for design. In the same vein, we’re not traditional developers but we certainly need to have development experience and expertise. Often this experience spans multiple technologies, languages, and platforms.

 ###

 — Tim R. Todish



---


It falls on <b>the UX developer to bridge the gap between design and technology</b>. We need to be able to think and speak the language of designers. It’s our job to help translate their vision to the development team in a way that they can understand and accept. This can be a critical piece of the puzzle in a project, especially if the design and the interactions behind it are complex.

###

 — Tim R. Todish



---


Similarly, we need to speak on behalf <b>the developers to help reign in the designers</b>, at times. If they are coming up with concepts that will be extremely difficult or time consuming to implement, we can explain the limitations of the technology and the complexity involved in implementing their designs, and try to come up with an acceptable alternative.

<b>Definition:</b> User experience (UX) design is the process that design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.  A UX designer is concerned with the entire <i>process</i> of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function.

<h3>UX Development Trajectories</h3>


 - One-person development team to build full-stack applications
 - A developer who speaks the language of the designers
 - A designer who can also build native prototypes
 - A bridge/translator between designers and developers in large/complex organizations
